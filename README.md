# Ad Placement Effectiveness Analyzer - R Shiny Dashboard

## Overview
Welcome to the Ad Placement Effectiveness Analyzer, an interactive web application developed using R Shiny. This tool is designed to help digital marketers assess the impact of product ad placements on click-through rates (CTR) on a website.

## Purpose
The primary objectives of this application are as follows:
1. Allow users to input data for three different ad placement locations: left sidebar, center page, and right sidebar.
2. Perform statistical analysis within the app to determine if there is a significant difference in CTRs based on ad placement.
3. Visualize CTR performance through interactive charts.
4. Provide a summary output communicating the results of the statistical analysis, including the p-value and whether the results are statistically significant at a 0.05 level of significance.

## Example Dataset
To facilitate ease of use, the application includes an example dataset based on the click-through rates (CTR) data provided in the research article "Navigating the Clickscape: Understanding the Impact of Ad Placement on Click-Through Rates." The dataset spans ten days, capturing CTRs for ZoomRunners ads placed in the left sidebar, center page, and right sidebar.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R Shiny application by running the `app.R` script.
3. Use the "Data Example" tab to explore the default dataset and the "Input Your Data" tab to input custom data.
4. Analyze the performance of ad placements on the "Data Analysis" tab, selecting various analysis options.

## Statistical Analysis
The application utilizes analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess whether there is a significant difference in CTRs for ad placements. The p-value is displayed in the summary output, helping users interpret the statistical significance of the results.

## Visualizations
Interactive line charts display the performance of ad placements over time, allowing users to visually assess trends and variations.

## Interpretation
The application provides insights into whether the choice of ad placement significantly impacts click-through rates. Users can make data-driven decisions regarding the effectiveness of different ad placement strategies on a website.

## Guide
For a comprehensive guide on how to use the application and interpret the results, please refer to the [User Guide](user-guide.md) included in this repository.

## Limitations
It's important to note the following limitations of the application:
- The analysis assumes independence and normality of residuals, standard assumptions for ANOVA.
- Users should exercise caution when generalizing findings to other digital platforms, as website layouts and user behaviors may vary.

## Reflection
### How could the insights gained from this application inform a digital marketerâ€™s strategy for ad placements on different types of websites or digital platforms?
The insights gained from this application can inform a digital marketer's strategy by:
- Identifying the most effective ad placement location based on statistical significance.
- Guiding decisions on optimizing CTR by adjusting ad placements.
- Offering a data-driven approach to understanding user engagement with specific ad locations.

By leveraging these insights, marketers can tailor their ad placement strategies to maximize click-through rates and enhance overall campaign effectiveness.

Feel free to explore the application, experiment with custom datasets, and gain valuable insights into the impact of ad placements on click-through rates!
